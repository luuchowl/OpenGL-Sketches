# OpenGL-Sketches
This repo holds some of my OpenGL shaders (based on many authors) and used to testing and consulting for other projects.


Update: I started a sketch everyday code challenge, so this sketchs are currently being uploaded in here, they are pretty rushed and spontaneous, they are not made to be a clean  on sintax and the code not production-ready. Actually, this is really a mess, but feel free to adventure through it.
